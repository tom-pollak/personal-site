    - Implemented an Open AI clip derivative to develop an Natrual-Language-Processing
      model that allowed users to search for any object in a video using a text box.
    - Extended the current on-camera model detection pipeline to feed image "blobs" into the new model.
    - The model produces embeddings indexable in with an Approximate-Nearest-Neighbor graph.
    - Implemented in C++, using PyTorch and NCNN deep learning frameworks.

  description:
    - Discovers undervalued horses by the bookmaker in each-way betting.
    - Uses a strategy that the bookmaker calculates the odds of a horse "placing" (1st, 2nd or 3rd) using only the win
      odds of the that horse. This simplifies odds calculation for the bookies, but is not entirely accurate.
    - The algorithm then uses an adapted Kelly Criterion strategy with Expected Growth to calculate the optimal stake.
